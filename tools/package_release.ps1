TsumuLightRecomp $Version

Tsumu Light boots and plays as a native Windows program with no emulator
behind it. This is an early preview -- a full playthrough has not been
verified, so expect rough edges.

This package does not include the Tsumu Light disc, the PlayStation BIOS, or
any game assets -- you supply those from your own collection, and the launcher
asks for them one at a time. The executable contains a statically recompiled
(machine-translated) build of the game's code, the same distribution model
used by other static recompilation projects such as N64: Recompiled.

First launch:
1. Run Tsumu_Light_Recompiled.exe. A launcher window opens.
2. Set your PlayStation BIOS: a legally obtained SCPH1001.BIN (512 KB).
   Tsumu Light is a Japanese (NTSC-J) title but the standard US SCPH1001
   works: the default instant boot skips the console's region check.
3. Set the game disc: your legally obtained Tsumu Light (Japan, SLPS-02253)
   image.
4. Pick a language in Localization (English is pre-selected), adjust options,
   then press Launch.

Disc image formats: .cue + .bin (pick the .cue) or .bin. Do NOT convert to a
2048-byte "cooked" .iso.

Memory cards are stored in the saves directory.
