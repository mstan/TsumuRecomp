# Tsumu Light Recomp — Release Notes

## v0.0.2 — 2026-07-10

### 🛠️ Critical boot fix

- **The v0.0.1 zip could fail to start on user machines.** It relied on a
  reference copy of the game's boot executable that only exists in a
  development checkout (it is game data, so it is never shipped in the zip).
  Without it the runtime's text-integrity guard never armed — the guard that,
  among other things, the English-translation layer depends on. The runtime
  now extracts that reference directly from **your disc image** — the same
  bytes the BIOS boots — so it works on every install.
- **The package is now self-contained.** v0.0.1 shipped loose MinGW runtime
  DLLs (`SDL2.dll`, `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`, …) which could collide with copies
  elsewhere on the DLL search path (`0xc000007b` on launch). v0.0.2 is a
  single statically-linked executable importing only Windows system DLLs.
- The package now also ships `game.toml`, the English `translations/` tables,
  release notes, and a `START_HERE.txt`.

## v0.0.1 — 2026-07-06

First public release. Tsumu Light (Japan, SLPS-02253) statically recompiled to a
native Windows executable on the [PSXRecomp](https://github.com/mstan/psxrecomp)
framework.

### Highlights
- **Playable end to end** — boots via instant HLE boot straight into the game.
- **English fan-translation** applied at runtime: HUD, menus, stage names, and
  the memory-card save/format/quit dialogs. Selectable in the launcher
  (Settings → Localization: **English** default, or **Default** for the
  untranslated original).
- **Integrated Dear ImGui launcher** for video, audio, controller, memory-card, and
  localization settings. Digital-pad only (Tsumu is a digital game), so the
  pad-mode picker is hidden.
- **Controller support** — keyboard or a DualShock/DualSense, chosen in the
  launcher's device dropdown.

### Notes
- Requires your own legally obtained Tsumu Light disc and a PS1 BIOS
  (`SCPH1001.BIN`); NTSC-J region. Neither is distributed here.
- Generated recomp C, the disc image, BIOS, memory cards, and launcher cover art
  are produced/supplied locally and are not part of this repository.
