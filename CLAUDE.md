# TsumuRecomp Rules

Static recompilation of **Tsumu Light** (Japan) — serial **SLPS-02253** — to
native code, built with the shared **psxrecomp** framework. The end goal is a
binary that plays without an emulator behind it, exactly like TombaRecomp.

## Inheritance

This project inherits, in order:

1. `F:/Projects/recomp-template/PRINCIPLES.md` — system-agnostic recomp/debug
   discipline (ground truth = original EXE + emulator oracle; generated C is
   evidence, not authority; first-divergence; no guessing).
2. The framework constitution at `psxrecomp-v4/CLAUDE.md` — a junction →
   a psxrecomp worktree. Read it first: no MIPS interpreter, no HLE BIOS shims,
   no stubs, recompiled-BIOS-first, fix the framework/runtime/config and
   **regenerate** — never hand-edit `generated/`.

## Project rules

- Game binaries (disc image, extracted boot EXE, the headerless Ghidra dump),
  Ghidra databases, memory cards, and build outputs are **local only** and must
  not be committed. See `.gitignore`.
- Tracked: `game.toml`, `seeds/`, `annotations/`, `ghidra/instructions.txt`,
  `ghidra/scripts/`, `ghidra/annotations/`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `tools/`, docs.
- Codegen/runtime fixes belong in the framework (`psxrecomp-v4/`) or in
  per-game `game.toml` config — never in `generated/*.c`. A fix that only this
  game needs is a smell; prefer a class fix that the next title inherits.
- After every run, resolve all dispatch misses before any other debugging.
- The framework version this project builds against is pinned in
  `psxrecomp-v4.pin`.

## Region note

Tsumu Light is an **NTSC-J (SLPS)** title. The PSX boot ROM region-locks the
disc against the console BIOS, so this game wants a **Japanese BIOS**
(SCPH1000/SCPH5500) — a US BIOS (SCPH1001/SCPH5501) may reject the disc at the
license check. If the recompiled-BIOS boot fails the region/license check, swap
in a JP BIOS and rebuild.
